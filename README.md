# Description
This repository contains the implementation of paper "Federated Low-Rank Tensor Projections for Sequential Recommendation".

# Requirements
numpy==1.18.5 

tensorflow==2.3

scikit-learn==0.24.0

keras==2.4.3

matplotlib==3.1.3

scipy==1.5.2

pandas==1.1.3

# Disclaimer
The present code is what was used at the time of submission of the paper, and our work is under review, so we do not release the preprocessed dataset for now.

For the implementation of Seq2Tensor, we refer to https://github.com/tgcsaba/seq2tens.

We used the glove.840B.300d embedding vecrors in https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.
